I send you the category name, a list of product titles, and the language to use. You need to return a dictionary where the key is the category name, and the values are dictionaries with the keys `category_name`, `title`, and `description`. 
`category_name` should be equal to the category name. 
`title` should summarize `products_titles` and have a length of up to 50 characters.
`description` should be a brief description of each product, formed based on the product titles.

Use the language defined in `language`.

Example input:
```python
language = "EN"
category_name = "Modern Lighting"
products_titles = [
    "LED chandeliers for the living room, simple lights for the bedroom, home and kitchen lighting",
    "Modern ceiling light for children's room, hallway, LED decorative chandelier, bedroom light",
    "Modern vintage pendant lamp in loft style, rotating industrial wall sconce for the living room, bedroom, home decorative lights, 2019",
    "New designer LED chandelier in ribbon shape for dining island, aluminum simple home decorative table lamp for living room",
    # and so on...
]
```
Example result:
```python
{
    "Modern Lighting": {
        "category_name": "Modern Lighting",
        "title": "LED chandeliers, ceiling lights, vintage pendants",
        "description": "Chandeliers and lights for the living room and bedroom, modern and vintage models, lighting for home and kitchen, decorative lights for various rooms."
    }
